# GitRevisionTool
Prints out the current Git revision info of a working directory and automatically writes it into your .NET project for the build.

**This repository is deprecated!** GitRevisionTool and SvnRevisionTool have been replaced by the unified NetRevisionTool.
See http://unclassified.software/apps/netrevisiontool for further information.
No further development of the old applications takes place and the GitRevisionTool repository will eventually be deleted.
Please update your bookmarks and/or fork the new repository for the latest (and greatly refactored) source code.
